# Analysing Kenya's 2022 Presidential Elections

This project seeks to analyse presidential election results first at county level then national level of the hotly contested race between **Dr William Ruto, Raila Odinga, Prof George Wajackoyah** and **Waihiga Mwaure**. 

In addition, a comparison of results was also done at county level between results officially announced by Kenya's electoral body, **IEBC** and that from independent observers from local to international media.

Finally, a determination through analysis was made to understand voter turnout rates relative to registered voters prior to the election in order to determine areas which need more awareness creation on the importance of exercising 
democratic rights as enshrined in Kenya's 2010 Constitution.
